恢复写文章也并不是突发的想法，只是觉得有必要用文字记录下来之前做过一些东西的insight，最近脑子不太好，记忆力变差了，怕有一天真忘了当时的insight就很可惜

这些insight存在于代码中，可能是突发奇想的想法，也有自己对于部分内容的理解，它们并不适合整理成学术文章，但是或许依然是有价值的一些东西和指导

github也好，还是拿公众号去写其实都一样，所以内容实际上是多端一起发布的，用公众号是为了方便分享；用github是为了能够不丢失

Resuming writing articles wasn't an impulsive decision, but rather a recognition of the necessity to document insights from past projects. Lately, my memory hasn't been great, and I fear that losing these insights would be a pity.

These insights are embedded within the code—some may be spontaneous ideas, others are my personal interpretations of certain aspects. They might not be suitable for academic papers, but they still hold valuable insights and guidance.

Whether it's on GitHub or shared through a public account, the platform doesn't really matter as the content is published across multiple channels. Using a public account makes it easier to share, while GitHub ensures that the content is preserved.
